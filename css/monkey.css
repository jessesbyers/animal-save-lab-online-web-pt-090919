/* Write your solution here */

/*Take advantage of media queries using max-width for desktop down and min-width for mobile
 up designs. Also utilize positioning: absolute, as well as properties such as top:,
 left:, right: ,bottom: to set the animals' positioning. You can also use CSS transform:
 rotate() if you wish to turn the animals. A single media query should be used to solve
 each page.*/

 /*For the monkey, use a combination of min-width and max-width to set a media query that 
 will allow the monkey to jump up over the Spice Girls
 from screen size of 406px to 1170px keeping him safe from their affection.*/
