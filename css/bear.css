html {
  background: url(../images/cliff.jpg) no-repeat top left;
}

#bear {
  position: absolute;
  top: 100px;
  right: 0;
}

/* Write your solution here */

@media screen and (min-width: 1196px) {
 div {
   position: fixed;
   left: 800px;
 }
}


/* min-width for mobile up designs.
Also utilize positioning: absolute, as well as properties such as top:,
 left:, right: ,bottom: to set the animals' positioning.
 You can also use CSS transform:
 rotate() if you wish to turn the animals.

/*For the bear, when sizing the browser from smaller to larger (mobile up),
when the screen reaches 1196px stop him from falling off the cliff by setting him
to stay 800px from the left side of the screen before he reaches the edge.*/
