/* Write your solution here */

/*Take advantage of media queries using max-width for desktop down and min-width for mobile
 up designs. Also utilize positioning: absolute, as well as properties such as top:,
 left:, right: ,bottom: to set the animals' positioning. You can also use CSS transform:
 rotate() if you wish to turn the animals. A single media query should be used to solve
 each page.*/

 /*For the dolphin, using min-width and max-width to help her rotate and jump up through
 the hoop from screen sizes of 642px to 1090px. Note: you can use transform: rotate()
 command to accomplish this. */

@media screen and (min-width: 642px) and (max-width: 1090px) {
  img {
    transform: rotate(-90deg);
    position: relative;
  }
}
