/*Take advantage of media queries using max-width for desktop down and min-width for mobile
 up designs. Also utilize positioning: absolute, as well as properties such as top:,
 left:, right: ,bottom: to set the animals' positioning. You can also use CSS transform:
 rotate() if you wish to turn the animals. A single media query should be used to solve
 each page.*/

 /*For the ostrich, starting with the screen larger and dragging it smaller (desktop down) 
 have the ostrich jump upwards 100px closer to the top of the screen to avoid being eaten
  by the alligator. As the screen gets smaller then he will run on top of Mr. Alligator's
   back.*/
